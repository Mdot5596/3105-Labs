SO IN READ ME TALK ABOUT HOW I CONFIRMED MY IDEA
WRITE ABOUT RESEARCH I TOOK (CITE A SOURCE IN 5 YEARS)



Create a single “.zip” archive (max 150MB) containing a txt link to the public GitHub readme/report, 
the executable and required libraries to run it. Detail how to run the executable (put that in the write
up below). Don’t forget to include any other resources required; meshes, sounds etc. Submit your zip 
file to the DLE electronic submission system. And don’t forget to remove any unneeded files and 
folders. Compress any additional resources or assets to stay within the space limit.
